## Home prices in the US have always been rising

The housing and rental prices have perpetually remained susceptible to market dynamics, exhibiting fluctuations over time as they rise and fall in response to the overall market outlook. Through this project and final visualization, I delve into the intricate dynamics of the housing market, spanning the past two decades across the United States.

I have downloaded the data from Zillow - https://www.zillow.com/research/data/ and using d3 + html + css to define the viz. I am hosting my page on github pages.


## Messaging

The narrative visualization aims to communicate the upward nature of housing prices across the United States from 2000 to 2022. By illustrating this data, the project seeks to provide viewers with a comprehensive understanding of - 

1. The trend in rising housing prices
2. Variation of the data across different states, and 
3. Major economic events that have influenced the housing market over the years. 


## Narrative Structure:

I have chosen martini glass narrative structure for the visualization project. This visualization begins with a pre-defined author deriven  slideshow showing the chaning housing prices for each state from 2000 to 2022. There are annotations displayed in the screen for each year which allows viewrs to understand what the author is tryign to convey. This is the stem of the martini glass. Once the animation runs through 2022, the visualization open ups for the users to explore. It allows the user to navigate through different years to compare the prices. See the major economic events happenign each year. Re-run the animation. The user can then drill down and filter the data for specific state to see trend for each individual states.
