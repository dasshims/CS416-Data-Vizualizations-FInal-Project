# Narrative visualization for US housing price

## Overview
Home prices in the US have always been rising. The housing and rental prices have perpetually remained susceptible to market dynamics, exhibiting only a little fluctuations over time as they rise and fall in response to the overall market outlook. Through this project and final visualization, I delve into the intricate dynamics of the housing market, spanning the past two decades across the United States.
